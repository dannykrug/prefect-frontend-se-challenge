# Prefect Front End Software Engineer Challenge

Welcome to the Prefect Front End Software Engineer Challenge!

This challenge consists of 3 exercises. Please spend no more
than 2 hours total on this challenge; the goal is to get a sense for how you
solve problems and implement your code - the questions are not
designed to trick you.

You can get your project set up with the following steps:

## Project setup

To start, install the project dependencies.

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

Then, start your development server.

```
npm run serve
```

### Lints and fixes files

You can run the automatic linter with this command. Note: all the necessary config files are included in the project, which you can use to enable lint on save in your IDE if it isn't already.

```
npm run lint
```
