# Prefect Front End Software Engineer Challenge

Welcome to the Prefect Front End Software Engineer Challenge!

This challenge consists of 3 exercises. Do your best to complete all 3, but please spend no more
than 3 hours total on this challenge; the goal is to get a sense for how you
solve problems and implement your code - the questions are not
designed to trick you.

No additional packages or libraries are required to complete this
challenge but you may add any that you wish. Please do not modify this
instructions component (found at `/src/views/Instructions.vue`) or any of the instruction text
for the exercise (these will be clearly denoted in the code) until your
submission has been graded. Any other code (including router, store,
styling, and components) are free for you to modify at your discretion.

Continue reading for project setup and submission.
