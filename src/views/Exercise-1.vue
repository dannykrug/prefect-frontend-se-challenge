      <p>
        You're building an application that has an inbox to display email-like
        messages between users. Someone else on your team has scaffolded the
        feature but you've been asked to extend the component to resolve the
        following user stories.
      </p>

      <ul class="instruction-list ma-auto">
        <strong>A user can...</strong>
        <li>
          see when a message is
          <strong>urgent</strong> (these messages contain a top-level key
          (<code>message.urgent</code>) to denote this)
        </li>
        <li>
          see previews of messages without opening them
        </li>
        <li>
          delete messages
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="info-box text-caption ma-auto my-6">
        <em>Tip #1:</em> There are many ways to achieve these user stories. You
        should read through the source component to get an understanding of how
        it works.
