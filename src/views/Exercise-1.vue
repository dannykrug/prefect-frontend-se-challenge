      You're building an application that has an inbox to display email-like
      messages between users. Someone else on your team has scaffolded the
      feature but you've been asked to extend the component to resolve the
      following user stories:
    </p>

    <ul class="instruction-list ma-auto">
      <li>
        if a message is marked as <strong>urgent</strong> (a top-level key in
        the message's data structure), a small <icon></icon> should appear in
        the title of the message
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="info-box text-caption ma-auto my-6">
      <em>Tip:</em> There are many ways to achieve these user stories. You
      should read through the source component to get an understanding of how it
      works.
